# Atari 5200 SuperSystem Cartridge CRC List
# Note: This list is provided as a record of known dumps for this system.  
#       These checksums have not been validated and cannot be assumed correct.  
#       They are provided here as a database to help the emulation of this system.  
# Send corrections and submissions to: battlepriest@hotmail.com

# Additonal notes for this list:
# A few games appear to have 16k and 32k versions, some of these may be
# incorrectly dumped or, may simply be alternate versions. Both appear 
# to work under the v5200 emulator. Anyone with more information about 
# this, please contact me at battlepriest@hotmail.com
# Note also that even images flagged as "working" have some input problems.
# The bankswitched cartridge "Bounty Bob", by virtue of being a multi-image
# is not included in this list.
