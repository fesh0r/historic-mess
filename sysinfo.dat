The Atari 5200 was introduced in 
1982, and was actually designed 
to be a competitor to the 
Intellivision, before ColecoVision
entered the market. Developed under 
the name of "Pam" (Atari, at the 
time, typically named projects after 
well-endowed female employees),
Atari considered releasing it with 
that moniker; PAM in this case an
acronym for "Personal Arcade
Machine".

The 5200 shared much of the 
architecture of the Atari 
400/800 computers, but 
featured a different cartridge 
connector and completely 
different controllers.  
Non-centering analogue 
joysticks which offered a full 
360 degrees of mobility, were 
both innovative and unreliable. 
Other controller features 
included a keypad, and a 
ahead-of-it's-time pause 
button.

The Atari 5200 suffered from 
it's initial incompatability 
with the VCS/2600 (an adapter 
was later released) and fierce 
competition from Coleco. When 
Warner Communications sold
Atari Corp. to the Tramiels 
in 1984, they quickly removed 
it from the market.

# a7800

Originally developed in 1984 as
the Atari 3600, the Atari 7800 
Prosystem was released to the US 
market in 1986, in an attempt to 
compete in a revitalised home 
videogame market. The 7800 was 
actually designed by Gencomp as 
part of a lawsuit settlement 
(Gencomp had been sued for 
releasing a speedup chipset for 
early Atari Coinops).

The 7800 was compatible 
with pre-existing Atari 2600 
game program cartridges, without
the need for expansion modules or
turning switches, but was also 
designed to use enhanced 
7800-only cartridges such as the
pack-in "Pole Position 2".
(n.b., only the 7800-specific
cartridges are currently 
supported in MESS.) Many 
peripherals, including a 
computer/keyboard and high score
saving cartridge were planned but
never released.

Unfortunately for Atari, the system 
did poorly in the late 1980's 
market dominated by Nintendo.

www.atari-history.com has this
interesting anecdote:
"In the summer of 1984 the first 
5,000 Atari 7800's had just been 
built in the new El Paso assembly 
plant.   The production line 
manager, Brad Saville was eager to 
meet with Jack Tramiel to show him 
the new flagship Atari video game 
console.   The meeting ended 
abruptly as Jack Tramiel was 
quoted "Get your pollution out of 
here!   We make computers now and 
we don't want your garbage." The 
line manager was fired 2 days later.
About 8-9 months later the line 
manager received a phone call from 
Atari asking him as to the 
whereabouts of the die molds for 
the Atari 7800. The ex-line manager 
responded that he did in fact know 
where they were and for $50/hour 
for about 200 to 300 hours of his 
time he would remember where they 
were and find them. The Atari Corp. 
representative who called was 
infuriated and informed the former 
production line manager that 
Atari's lawyers would be in contact 
with him. He never heard from Atari 
again."

The game console commonly known as 
the "Bally Astrocade" was never 
officially sold by that name, having
originally been released by Bally 
Manufacturing in 1978 as the Bally 
Professional Arcade. It was 
withdrawn rather quickly though, 
due to the success of the competing
Atari VCS. A group of Pro Arcade 
enthusiasts under the name 
Astrovision Inc., bought the rights 
to the Pro Arcade and reintroduced 
it as the Bally Computer System,
including the Basic casettrige as a 
pack-in. In 1982, the system and 
company was renamed Astrocade, once
again trying to market it as a video
game system. The system didn't last 
much longer, though; it was a product 
with a limited interest base even 
before the video game slump of the 
next few years.

# coleco

The ColecoVision video game 
system was released in August 
of 1982 for a suggested retail 
price of $175 US. Similar at 
it's core to the MSX computer, 
ColecoVision had both superior 
graphics and more expansion 
capabilities compared to it's 
chief rivals: the Atari 2600 
and Intellivision. Among the 
expansion module options were 
a hardware Atari 2600 emulator, 
and a Steering Wheel for 
driving games, both unheard of 
at the time.

The competitive price, 
technical superiority, and 
perhaps more importantly, the 
inclusion of Donkey Kong as the 
pack-in cartridge, led to Coleco 
becoming an industry leader. 
With the emergence of the 
popularity of home computers, 
however, the console market 
seemed in jeopardy of losing 
it's share to the likes of 
Commodore and Apple. Coleco 
responded by releasing the Adam 
Family Computer as both a 
standalone unit and as an 
expansion to the ColecoVision 
itself. 

The Adam was a phenomenal market 
failure though, and Coleco 
pulled itself from both the 
console and computer markets 
just before the game market 
crash in late 1984.

Telegames purchased the rights to 
the system, and many of the 
manufactured games, and released 
a clone, The Personal Arcade, in 
1988. It was later re-released by 
them, as the DINA, which is still 
sold today.

# vectrex

$info=vectrex

$bio
The Vectrex was released in 
the US late in 1982 by General 
Consumer Electric (GCE) at a 
suggested retail price of $199. 
The Vectrex differed from other 
consoles in that it had it's own 
built in nine inch by eleven 
inch vector monitor, and thus 
didn't require (or even allow) 
the use of a television set. The 
system even contained a built in 
game, the Asteroids-like 
"Minestorm". 

The monochrome Vectrex used 
screen overlays to give the 
illusion of colour, and also to 
reduce the severity of the 
inherent flickering caused by 
the vector monitor.

in 1983, GCE was merged into 
Milton Bradley, who expanded 
the Vectrex's market to include 
Europe. As the video game market 
declined and then crashed, the 
Vectrex exited the market in 
early 1984. The rights to the 
system reverted to it's 
developers, Smith Engineering. 

Smith Engineering briefly 
considered designing a handheld 
version of the device in 1988, 
though the success of the 
Nintendo Gameboy made such a 
project too risky. In the 
mid-1990s, Smith Engineering 
condoned the duplication of 
the Vectrex system image and 
cartridges for non-commercial 
uses.
