# Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Command Module CRC List
# Note: This list is provided as a record of known dumps for this system.  
#       These checksums have not been validated and cannot be assumed correct.  
#       They are provided here as a database to help the emulation of this system.  
# Send corrections/submissions to: battlepriest@hotmail.com

# Notes for this System: Images of Command Modules (TI99 cartridges) are frequently 
# split into a GROM (image name ending in G), a ROM (Ending in C), and a Banked 
# Image (Ending in d). Generally, only those modules with only a GROM image are 
# loadable as a single image under MESS. This list only contains modules that can be 
# loaded as a single image (i.e. requiring no C or D images, and/or no data disk).

# Thanks to JoJo for many submissions to this list. :-)
